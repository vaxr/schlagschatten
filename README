SYNOPSIS

You are a space fighter pilot in a hopeless struggle against the alien
invaders. Your sensory systems are damaged, and the only source of
light you have is the battle itself. How many alien fighters can you
take with you?


INSTALLATION

The game requires Python2 and pygame. It was built with Python 2.7.5
and might run on lower versions. For the music to work, you need to
have sidplay2 installed and in your path.

Note that no efforts were made to make the game run on any other than
the development machine.


BACKGROUND

The game was made in 8 hours for the Berlin Mini Game Jam 07/2013 [1],
and is presented here with minimal changes, for general amusement. The
code is a mess and there are currently no plans of improving the game.

The idea is based on 3/4 of the jam's themes:
- light and shadow
- retro
- pixel art
